  <p>If you’re a beginner to code and just started learning HTML and CSS, you may be wondering what <br>
      HTML and CSS projects you can do to <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/html-css-projects/">build your portfolio </a>and hone your skills. You might even ask <br>
       whether or not you can actually do anything with just HTML and CSS knowledge! The good news is that <br>
       there are many types of HTML and CSS projects out there that beginners can use to practice coding, <br>
        build up skills, keep learning, level up your knowledge, and <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/html-css-projects/">even start earning money. </a>  <br> <br>
<p>
    The first website I built — the final project of a video lesson series on an online learning platform — <br>
     was made purely with HTML and CSS. Even though it was a basic static web page for a fake bakery that <br>
     would never be seen or hosted anywhere, I was thrilled. I had created something that wasn’t there <br>
      before, using code. As an English major, using language in this tangible way was new to me, and HTML <br>
       and CSS made it possible. The experience motivated me to continue learning — I’m still learning today, <br>
        even after years of working as a software engineer.
